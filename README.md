# Parser
This is an implementation of a parser for a didactic programing language.
It is being developed as a college project, for the "Compiladores" (Compilers) course.

This parser implementation describes a simple programing language, used only to didactic goals. 
The gramatic that defines this language is available in http://dei.unicap.br/~silvio/compiladores/parser (only in Portuguese).
The symble table (topic 6 on the document) was not implemented here.

This project was being developed and tested using Java version "1.7.0_80" with NetBeans IDE 8.1 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (32 bits) environment.
